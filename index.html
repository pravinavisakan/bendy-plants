		<h1>CS275 Final Project: L-System Plants</h1>	
		<p> Project by Pravin Visakan, ID: 504825910 </p>
		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		  <p>Real plants exist as physical entities in a physical world, and the interaction between the two can     affect overall plant structure. This project explores the use of physics simulation to produce phy    sically-influenced structures. In the course of doing so, a variant of the L-System formalism is de    veloped. This more object-oriented plant model leverages common programming constructs and compatib    ility with common game engine architectures.</p>
